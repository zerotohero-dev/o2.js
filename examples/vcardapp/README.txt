This application is a step-by-step demo accompanying

	http://o2js.com/2011/12/04/how-to-create-a-modular-and-organized-web-application/

article series.

I will be pushing updates to this folder as I continue to write the series.

This demo project is assumed to be run under

	http://{siteRoot}/o2.js/examples/vcardapp.

Testing it in a different folder may cause problems.

The PHP version the application uses is 5.3.6.

Cheers,
Volkan Özçelik
