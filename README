About o2.js
________________________________________________________________________________

Front-end development and front-end performance optimization has always been my 
passion. And at o2.js, I aim to reflect this passion:

    * o2.js will be fast,
    * o2.js will be flexible,
    * o2.js will be reliable.
    
"In the land of heavy JavaScript libraries, o2.js will be like fresh oxygen ;)."

o2.js is in still in its growth phase with a pretty stable code base.

Yet Another JavaScript Framework?! Seriously?
________________________________________________________________________________

Well, o2.js is not and end-result. It is a "by-product". Let me explain:

Up till now, I've used various JavaScript techniques, analyzed and used almost 
all of the popular JavaScript frameworks, and have built a dozen of JavaScript 
libraries, from the ground up, myself.

In that regard, my aim was *not* to develop yet another JavaScript framework. 
My goal was to blog about peculiarities, intricacies, best-practices, patterns, 
use-cases, implementations of re-usable, cross-platform, optimized JavaScript 
code at http://o2js.com/.

As a result, at http://o2js.com/ I dived deep into the realm of JavaScript, 
while trying to seek out library-independent solutions, sharing my experiences 
along the way. I still actively blog and continue sharing my knowledge and 
experience there.

Ironically enough, while blogging at http://o2js.com, I realized that the code 
snippets that I was mixing together as blog posts were evolving into a solid 
and re-usable JavaScript framework. 

Hope you like the outcome ;).

Supported Platforms & User Agents
________________________________________________________________________________

o2.js is being designed to run pretty smoothly in almost any device/user agent.
o2.js utilizes modern features whenever possible, while gracefully degrading to 
slower alternatives for the less capable browsers. For instance, o2.js DomHelper 
selectors will try to use DOM Level 2 native querySelector method if available,
and will fall back to a good-old for loop otherwise.

o2.js is constantly being developed keeping backwards compatibility in mind.
Before each major release, o2.js will be unit-tested in *at least* 
the following browsers/platforms:

    * IE6/Windows IE7/Windows IE8/Windows IE9/Windows
    * Firefox/Linux (the Most Recent Stable Version)
    * Opera/Linux (the Most Recent Stable Version)
    * Google Chrome/Linux (the Most Recent Stable Version)
    * Firefox/Windows (the Most Recent Stable Version)
    * Opera/Windows (the Most Recent Stable Version)
    * Google Chrome/Windows (the Most Recent Stable Version)
    * Safari/Windows (the Most Recent Stable Version)
